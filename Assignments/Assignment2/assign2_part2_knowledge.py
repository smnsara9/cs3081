# THE MYSTERY (same story, new twist)
# ============================================================
# A laptop went missing from the CS lab at Effat University.
# Three suspects: Sara, Lina, Nora
#
# The clues:
#   Clue 1: If Lina has a key  -->  Lina is guilty.
#   Clue 2: Sara does NOT have a key.
#   Clue 3: Lina was seen near the lab.
#   Clue 4: If Lina was seen near the lab  -->  Lina has a key.
#   Clue 5 (NEW): Nora has an alibi (she was NOT near the lab).
#   Clue 6 (NEW): If someone has NO alibi  -->  they are suspicious.
